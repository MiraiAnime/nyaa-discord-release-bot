# nyaa-discord-release-bot

___

written in python

---

control the bot with the `.` option.

something like `.help` will get yourself a list of options

dont forget to set the notification channel with `.set_channel`, on every restart

---

bot reads token from `.env` file looking like this:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=<put your token here>
```

and `.requirements` will include added search patterns on each line, like so:
```
BDMV
Moozzi2
```
while you can write these settings to the file yourself, I would much rather just configure them using the bot commands (`.help`)
